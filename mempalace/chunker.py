chunker.py — Meaning-aware text chunking for the palace.

The previous chunker hard-cut at exactly CHUNK_SIZE chars, producing
mid-word fragments. This module replaces the cut with a backward
boundary search (paragraph → sentence → newline → word) and adds
content-type exclusion for tool-output noise (logs, ps, diffs,
truncation messages).

Two public entry points:

- ``smart_split(text, target, ceiling)`` — split a single string into
  boundary-aware chunks. Used by both the conversation chunker and the
  general miner.
- ``is_excluded_content(text)`` — return True if the chunk is dominated
  by tool-output noise and should be skipped from indexing.

These functions are pure: no I/O, no chromadb, no LLM. Unit-testable.

#                that just ended).
#   skip_chars — total length of the separator (so the next chunk starts
#                at sep_pos + skip_chars).

    The chunker calls this on each candidate chunk. A True result means

    description with one timestamp embedded is fine), but to drop
    chunks that ARE log dumps, ps listings, or line-numbered diffs.

    Heuristics, all line-ratio-based so a small log fragment in prose

    - >=70% of non-empty lines start with a log/timestamp prefix
    - >=50% of non-empty lines look like a ps row
